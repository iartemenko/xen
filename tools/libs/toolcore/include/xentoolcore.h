/*
 * int xentoolcore_restrict_all(domid_t domid);
 *
 * Arranges that Xen library handles (fds etc.) which are currently held
 * by Xen libraries, can no longer be used other than to affect domid.
 *
 * Does not prevent effects that amount only to
 *   - denial of service, possibly host-wide, by resource exhaustion etc.
 *   - leak of not-very-interesting metainformation about other domains
 *     eg, specifically, event channel signals relating to other domains
 *
 * If this cannot be achieved, returns -1 and sets errno.
 * If called again with the same domid, it may succeed, or it may
 * fail (even though such a call is potentially meaningful).
 * (If called again with a different domid, it will necessarily fail.)
 *
 *  ====================================================================
 *  IMPORTANT - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
 *
 *  This function has been implemented insofar as it appears necessary
 *  for the purposes of running a deprivileged qemu, and is believed to
 *  be sufficient (subject to the caveats discussed in the appropriate
 *  libxl documentation for this feature).
 *
 *  However, this function is NOT implemented for all Xen libraries.
 *  For each use case of this function, the designer must evaluate and
 *  audit whether the implementation is sufficient in their specific
 *  context.
 *
 *  Of course, patches to extend the implementation are very welcome.
 *  ====================================================================
 *
 * Thread safe.
 *
 * We expect that no callers do the following:
 *   - in one thread call xen_somelibrary_open|close
 *   - in another thread call fork
 *   - in the child of the fork, before exec, call
 *     xen_some[other]library_open|close or xentoolcore_restrict_all
 *
